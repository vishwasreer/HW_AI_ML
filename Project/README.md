### Matrix Multiplication Using Systolic Arrays - Hardware Accelerator

## Overview
This project implements a hardware accelerator for matrix multiplication using systolic array architecture in SystemVerilog. It features a modular, scalable design optimized for AI/ML workloads. The accelerator interfaces with software via an APB slave interface, enabling seamless communication and control from Python or other host programs.
The goal is to demonstrate hardware-software co-design by offloading matrix multiplication to a custom accelerator and comparing its performance with standard CPU-based libraries like NumPy.

## Features
Parameterizable matrix size (e.g., 32x32)
Systolic array design for efficient parallel multiply-accumulate operations
APB slave interface for communication with host software
Fully verified using Cocotb testbench framework
Performance benchmarking against NumPy matrix multiplication
Comprehensive documentation and waveform captures included
