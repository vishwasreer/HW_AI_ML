### Matrix Multiplication Using Systolic Arrays - Hardware Accelerator

## Overview
This project implements a hardware accelerator for matrix multiplication using systolic array architecture in SystemVerilog. It features a modular, scalable design optimized for AI/ML workloads. The accelerator interfaces with software via an APB slave interface, enabling seamless communication and control from Python or other host programs.
The goal is to demonstrate hardware-software co-design by offloading matrix multiplication to a custom accelerator and comparing its performance with standard CPU-based libraries like NumPy.

## Features
Parameterizable matrix size (e.g., 32x32)
Systolic array design for efficient parallel multiply-accumulate operations
APB slave interface for communication with host software
Fully verified using Cocotb testbench framework
Performance benchmarking against NumPy matrix multiplication
Comprehensive documentation and waveform captures included

# Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Cocotb (for testbench and verification)

SystemVerilog simulator (e.g., Questa)


# Getting Started
Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/systolic-matmul-accelerator.git
cd systolic-matmul-accelerator
Set up Python environment

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run simulations

To simulate the design and run verification tests using Cocotb:


make sim
This will compile the RTL, run the testbench, and generate waveform files in /waveforms.

Run the Python benchmark script


# Project Details
The systolic array module implements a grid of multiply-accumulate units arranged for data flow efficiency.

The APB slave module provides register-based control and data access, allowing software to initiate matrix operations and read results.

The testbench exercises functional correctness and timing, including corner cases such as zero matrices and non-square inputs.
